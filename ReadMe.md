This python program batch renames downloaded email PDFs with
their time stamp. Ie: 1-31-20_Email.pdf
It accomplishes this by reading the pdf and searching for the time stamp on the top left corner of the PDF.
It is designed to work in conjuncture with Apple Mail when multiple 
emails are downloaded as PDFs in a folder. 

This was created to make bulk email receipt renaming easier for better record keeping.
